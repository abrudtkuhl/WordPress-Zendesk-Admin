Integrates the Zendesk Web Widget into the WordPress Admin.

== Description ==
Integrate the Zendesk Web Widget into the WordPress admin to allow your users to submit help desk tickets and ask questions from inside the admin.

The widget pre-populates the logged in user\'s information with Name, Email Address, and Username. When they fill out the form it creates a help desk ticket in Zendesk passing in their information, their message, and what page they were on when they submitted the request.
